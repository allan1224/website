       A novel sensing device to record EEG from inside the ear

   <p>
    EEG is a non-invasive method for recording electrical brain activity.
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    Electricity is the natural language of the brain so EEG provides a natural way to interface with computers. 
    <div>&nbsp;</div> 
    The golden standard uses a gel-filled electrode cap, but it's impractical for everyday use due to messy gel, short time window for recording, and user discomfort. 
    <div>&nbsp;</div>Luckily, we can record EEG directly from the ear. This is a more accessible and practical way to record brain activity on for long-term, daily monitoring.
    <div>&nbsp;</div>We can implement an wearable BCI to capture cognitive signals recorded from the ear. 
    <div>&nbsp;</div>

    <!--
    Most in-ear devices use a custom made earpiece with dry electrodes. The tradeoff with dry electrodes is that they avoid the hassle with conductive gel but the cost is higher impedance and noise in the signal. Sometimes, conductive gel has been applied on these dry electrodes but it does come with technical feasibility challenges and user discomfort since you’re putting loose gel inside the ear, which is a very sensitive area. Other technology has used generic earpieces, also with dry electrodes. They’re very practical and mostly fit everyone, but at the cost of signal quality since they don’t provide an exact fit and use dry electrodes 

     <div>&nbsp;</div>
    So the novel idea is to integrate hydrogel sponge electrodes into a custom earpiece to record EEG, which has the benefit of lower impedance compared to dry electrodes but at the same time  does not suffer from the disadvantages of gel.  The earpieces are 3D printed and are custom molded to the subject’s ear, which integrate easily with the electrodes.

     <div>&nbsp;</div>
    The electrodes themselves are hydrogel-based sponge that use a conductive, patent-pending material called AIRTrode. So you can think of this in-ear technology as a unique application of the AIRTrode.  AIRTrode is a hydrogel that has been demonstrated to provide long-term and biocompatible recording compatible to commercial EEG gels in signal quality and window time of recording without suffering from the disadvantages of gel. We combine this with a PDMS-based sponge, which is also created in the lab, to get the AIRTrode sponge. And you basically pop-in the electrodes into the designated cavities of the earpiece and then remove them after use. 

     <div>&nbsp;</div>
    The electrodes fit very securely in the earpiece so they won’t fall out. 
    And the benefits to using the sponge are 1 - it acts as a carrier for the hydrogel and 2 - it provides robust contact quality due to the restorative force applied by the sponge against the ear. This is critical to achieving high quality signal.

   <p>
       Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects within an image or video. In the context of IoT devices, object detection can be used to select a device that the user wants to interact with. Motor Imagery EEG is a technology that detects the user's intention to perform a specific movement, such as grasping an object or moving a limb, by measuring electrical activity in the brain. By combining object detection with motor imagery EEG, users can select and control an IoT device through their thoughts. For example, a user could use object detection to select a smart light bulb and then use motor imagery EEG to turn it on or off without physically interacting with a switch or button.

   <p>
       Photobiomodulation is the application of near-infrared light to promote healing, decrease pain, and restore cellular energy balance. When this light shines on the brain, it can improve cognitive and emotional function. This is usually done with an expensive laser that requires special training, making it inconveneint for most people to use. This project is an attempt to provide a low cost, alternative, portable, and safe light therapy device.
