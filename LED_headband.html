        <p>Trasncranial photobiomodulation can increase cognitive funciton and promote a healthy brain. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97987-w">Previous research</a> has shown the effect of 1064 nm light on brain waves, corresponding to improved congitive funciton.

        Part of my job as a lab technician at the Gonzaelz-Lima lab is to analyze how a 1064 nm laser wtih a power density of 250 mW/cm^2 affects EEG signals. Below I've included some topo plots I made measuring the change in mean band powers between stimulation and placebo. The laser stimulation corresponds to an increase in mean alpha power and a decrease in mean beta and delta powers.

         However, this laser is extremely expensive and inconvenient for most people to actually use on a daily basis - we can't all have $20k lasers in our homes. This necessitates the need for a less expensive and more conveninent light therapy system. This LED headband device is an attempt at an alternative to the laser, based upon specifications of the laser that have demonstrated congitive benefits and change in EEG.

        <p>LED Forward voltage=1.5 V</p>
        <p>LED Forward current=1 A</p>
        <p>Power (watts)=V (volts)*I (amps)</p>
        <p>Total LED power=1.5 V*1 A=1.5 W (per LED)</p>
        <p>Total radiated power=750 mW (from datasheet)</p>
        <p>Effeciency=(total radiated power)/(total LED power)</p>
        <p>=0.75/1.5=0.5=50%</p>
        <p>Total device power=4*1.5 W=6 W</p> 
        <p>Because only 50% efficient, about half of the power goes into optical power</p>
        <p>The other half is turned into heat</p>
        <p>Heat watts=0.5*6 = 3 W</p>
        <p>Therefore, we must cool 3 W of heat power</p>

    <p>
     This project is separate from the LED device I am developing at the Gonzalez-Lima lab. The design of this particular device utilizes different circuit components and a thermal dissipation system. This makes it more portable and cheaper than the device being developed at the lab. All knowledge aquired in order to build this device is open source and can be found on the internet. Research regarding the device specifications was made possible by the Gonzalez-Lima lab. I am developing this device on my own time with my own resources, and therefore, the implementation of this project is my own.
